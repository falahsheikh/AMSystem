# Student Record System (SRS) using tkinter and MySQL

## Overview

This is a simple Student Record System (SRS) implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and MySQL as the backend database. The program allows users to manage and track student records, including details such as Student UID, Full Legal Name, Faculty, Date of Birth, Gender, Contact Information, and Address.

## Features

- Add new student records with various details.
- Update existing records.
- Delete records (not yet implemented in the current version).
- View and search through the stored records.
- Graphical user interface for ease of use.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library
- MySQL database server
- pymysql library

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pymysql
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure that your MySQL server is running.
2. Create a database named 'srs1' and set up a table named 'datasrs' with the required fields.
3. Update the database connection details in the program (`main.py`, lines 72-73).
4. Run the program using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Fill in the details in the "Enter Details" section.
3. Click the "Save" button to add a new record.
4. Click the "Update" button to modify an existing record.
5. Click the "Clear" button to reset the input fields.
6. Browse through the records in the main table.
7. Close the application when done.

## Important Note

- The "Delete" functionality is not yet implemented in the current version. You can extend the functionality by adding a suitable function and button.
- Ensure that you have proper error handling for database connections and operations in a production environment.

Feel free to modify and extend the program according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contribute.

Happy coding!
